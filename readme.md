# USU Community Center

## Abstract:

This is a proposal to utilize the space once occupied by the Artist's Block cafe as a community center for USU focused on free services for students, supported by donations and volunteers. This proposal is tentative, and serves mostly as a vision of what that space could possibly become. The purpose of this document is to convey the thoughts I've been having on forming more community at USU through this idea.

## Motivation:

I had the pleasure of visiting [The Front Porch](https://www.frontporchslo.org/), a coffee shop at Cal Poly in California where everything is free. It was amazing to see the community that flourished within its walls, and have been thinking about how I could attempt something similar here in Logan. It seems like the Artist's Block would be an ideal spot, given that it was already a cafe in its past life.

## Goals:
* Create an inclusive and welcome environment for anyone to join
* Provide a free-use community kitchen (maintained by volunteers)
* Provide free coffee, tea, and water
* Have ample seating and tables for working on homework and having conversation

## Business Model
I am getting in contact with Joel, the owner of The Front Porch, to see how they make ends meet. I believe that finances will be the most difficult aspect of a community center like this, but I am hoping to keep costs down with donations and volunteering. USU already has a great [volunteer outreach program](https://orgsync.com/login/utah-state-university) that could help incentivise students by giving them an opportunity to add volunteer experience to their resume.
